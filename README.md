## Quick Study Cheat Sheet

### **Economics**
- **Supply & Demand**
  - Law of Demand: ↑Price → ↓Quantity demanded  
  - Law of Supply: ↑Price → ↑Quantity supplied
- **Key Formulas**
  - GDP (Expenditure Approach):  
    `GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)`  
    Where C = consumption, I = investment, G = government spending, X = exports, M = imports
  - Inflation Rate:  
    `Inflation (%) = (CPI this year - CPI last year) / CPI last year × 100`

  - Perfect Competition, Monopoly, Oligopoly, Monopolistic Competition

---

### **Mathematics**
- **Algebra**
  - Quadratic Formula: `x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a`
- **Statistics**
  - Mean: `μ = Σx / n`  
  - Variance: `σ² = Σ(x - μ)² / n`  
  - Standard Deviation: `σ = √σ²`
- **Probability**
  - P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)  
  - P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B) (if independent)
