## Study Tips & Strategies

1. Combine subjects: use data science tools to analyze economic data, math formulas for real problems, history and law for context.  
2. Make summary notes & cheat sheets. Highlight key concepts, formulas, and cases.  
3. Practice regularly. Solve exercises in Math, Data Science, Economics, and Law.  
4. Explore online resources: tutorials, research papers, interactive sites.  
5. Use visualizations: charts, graphs, maps. Helps memorize faster.  
6. Organize study sessions: Pomodoro (25–30 min focus + 5 min break), track progress.  
7. Continuously expand: add new subjects, topics, and resources.
